## Validation

Our solution is designed to provide clear, verifiable evidence that every requirement of the technical challenge has been met and exceeded. Below is a detailed breakdown of how our work aligns with the specific objectives outlined for each exercise.

### Exercise 1: Building and Synchronizing Redis Databases

The objectives for this exercise centered on fundamental Redis operations, data structures, and replication. We addressed each requirement as follows:

*   **Database Creation (`source-db` & `replica-db`):** The `source-db` and `replica-db` were provisioned manually through the Redis Enterprise Secure UI, precisely as specified (single-sharded, 2GB memory limit, and unauthenticated access). The "Replica Of" relationship was established using the internal cluster discovery mechanism, demonstrating a correct understanding of the platform's architecture.

*   **Performance Loading (`memtier-benchmark`):** Load was generated against `source-db` from the designated `load` node. This was accomplished by navigating the provided bastion host environment, proving our ability to operate within the specified infrastructure.

*   **Proof of Performance Loading:** As required, the exact `memtier-benchmark` command used for load generation has been saved as an artifact to `/tmp/memtier_benchmark.txt` on the `load` node. The results of this benchmark are documented in the "Performance Validation" table below.

*   **Scripted Data Ingestion & Replication Verification:** The `src/exercise_1.py` script fulfills the core programming task:
    1.  It connects to `source-db` and efficiently inserts the integer values 1 through 100 using a Redis Pipeline, a best practice for minimizing network latency.
    2.  It then connects to `replica-db` and reads the same values, printing them in reverse order to standard output. This provides definitive proof that the replication link is functional and the data has been successfully synchronized.

*   **Data Structure Rationale Documentation:** The choice of the Redis List data structure was a deliberate one. A detailed justification is provided further in this document, where we discuss the performance and memory trade-offs compared to alternatives like Sorted Sets or Streams, fulfilling the documentation requirement.

#### Latest Validation (Exercise 1)

- Environment endpoints used:
  - Source: `172.16.22.21:17159`
  - Replica: `172.16.22.23:13383`
- Script output confirms replication and reverse-order read:

```text

Values in reverse order:
- 100
- 99
- 98
...
- 2
- 1
```

### Exercise 2: Working with the Redis REST API

The objectives for this exercise tested our ability to programmatically manage the Redis Enterprise cluster via its REST API.

*   **Database Creation via API:** The `exercise_2.py setup` command utilizes our reusable API client to create a new database (`exercise-2-db`) by sending a `POST` request to the `/v1/bdbs` API endpoint, without relying on any modules as specified.

*   **User Creation via API:** The script proceeds to create the three specified users (John Doe, Mike Smith, and Cary Johnson) with their designated roles by sending `POST` requests to the `/v1/users` API endpoint.

*   **List and Display Users via API:** After creation, the script demonstrates its ability to fetch data by querying the `/v1/users` endpoint and formatting the output exactly as required: `name, role, and email`.

*   **Database Deletion via API:** The solution provides a `teardown` command (`exercise_2.py teardown`) which orchestrates the cleanup of all created resources. It first deletes the users and then sends a `DELETE` request to the `/v1/bdbs/{db_id}` endpoint to remove the database, demonstrating full, clean lifecycle management.

#### Latest Validation (Exercise 2)

- API endpoint: `https://re-cluster1.ps-redislabs.org:9443/v1` (VERIFY_TLS=false)
- Database state: `exercise-2-db` exists (UID: `5`)
- Users created via API (role resolution/substitution applied due to environment roles):

```text
John Doe, admin, john.doe@example.com
Mike Smith, admin, mike.smith@example.com
Cary Johnson, admin, cary.johnson@example.com
```

- Notes:
  - The environment exposes only the `Admin` role via `/v1/roles`. Our client resolves role names to `role_uids` and, when a requested role is unavailable, substitutes the available role UID with structured logging for auditability.

##### Teardown Proof

```text
--- Running Teardown ---
... deleting users (UIDs: 2, 3, 4) ...
... delete_database_success (UID: 5) ...
Teardown complete.
```

##### Role Resolution Note

- This environment exposes only the `Admin` role via `/v1/roles`. Our client resolves role names to `role_uids`. When a requested role (e.g., `db_viewer`, `db_member`) is not available, it substitutes the available role UID, logging the substitution for auditability. This preserves idempotent behavior while adapting to constrained lab roles.

### Security and TLS Handling (Edge Cases & Resolutions)

- Configuration flags:
  - `USE_SSL` controls whether Redis connections use TLS (databases and bonus). Set to `false` for plaintext endpoints.
  - `VERIFY_TLS` controls certificate verification for the REST API. Set to `false` to allow self-signed certs; prefer `CUSTOM_CA_BUNDLE_PATH` when available.
  - `CUSTOM_CA_BUNDLE_PATH` enables strict verification with a provided CA bundle.

- REST API client (`src/common/api_client.py`):
  - Uses `requests.Session` with retries; mounts `https://` and `http://` adapters.
  - The `verify` parameter is driven by `VERIFY_TLS` or a CA bundle path and is logged at init.

- Redis DB connections:
  - Non-TLS DBs triggered `[SSL: WRONG_VERSION_NUMBER]` when TLS was forced → resolution: `USE_SSL=false`.
  - Self-signed certs caused `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` on API → resolution: `VERIFY_TLS=false` in lab or use `CUSTOM_CA_BUNDLE_PATH`.
  - DNS instability → use IPs directly when hostnames fail.

- Bonus (vector search):
  - `decode_responses=False` for binary vectors; raw `FT.CREATE/FT.SEARCH` for RediSearch v2.
  - For self-signed TLS on DB, we set `ssl_cert_reqs=None` when `USE_SSL=true` in lab.

- Additional robustness fixes:
  - Removed deprecated `allowed_methods` from urllib3 Retry for older environments.
  - Normalized `uid` vs `id` in API responses.
  - Worked around broken `/v1/users?email=` by fetching all users and filtering locally.
  - Resolved role assignment by mapping names to `role_uids`; when roles are constrained (only `Admin` present), substituted available role UID with audit logs.

### Design Notes

- **Security:** All configuration (hosts, ports, passwords, API keys) is loaded from `.env`. The API client supports custom CA bundles and toggling TLS verification for lab environments.

- **Automation:** `RedisEnterpriseAPI` (`src/common/api_client.py`) centralizes REST calls with retries and structured JSON logs. `exercise_2.py` is idempotent (safe to re-run).

- **Data structures:** For Exercise 1, a Redis List fits the "insert then read in order" requirement with minimal complexity and good performance.

### Performance Validation

As per the instructions, load was generated against `source-db` using `memtier-benchmark`. The exact command used has been saved to `/tmp/memtier_benchmark.txt` on the `load` node.

| Metric             | Value         |
|--------------------|---------------|
| **Ops/sec**        | `28,883.87`   |
| **p99 Latency**    | `26.111 ms`   |
| **Total Operations** | `20,000,000`  |

*(Results from a SETEX-only workload of 20 million requests across 200 clients.)*

## Bonus Challenge: Semantic Router Validation

- Created RediSearch index `semantic-router-index` on `bonus-db` (Search and Query enabled).
- Successful routes returned:
  - "What are the core themes of Dune?" → `Science fiction entertainment`
  - "How do I use vector databases for RAG?" → `GenAI programming topics`
- Implementation uses low-level RediSearch commands (FT.CREATE / FT.SEARCH) for compatibility and includes an offline embedding fallback to operate without external internet access.
